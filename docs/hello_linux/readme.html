        <a name="Purpose%20and%20scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This is a simple "Hello Linux" example that illustrates building a console application for ARM Linux.</div>

        <div class="para">This example's files can be found in the <span class="arg">...\hello_linux</span> directory within <span class="arg">Linux_examples.zip</span>.  Import this .zip archive into Eclipse to access the <span class="arg">hello_linux</span> project.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <div class="para">A host workstation (Linux or Windows) is required to build the example, communicate with the target, and run DS-5 Debugger.</div>
        <div class="para">The following software may also be needed on the host to run and debug the example:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in DS-5, TeraTerm for Windows (<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html" title="External link"><i>TeraTerm Website</i></a>) or minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.  This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the ARM Linux boot process and provide a terminal interface to ARM Linux.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.  To open the Terminal view in DS-5, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click OK.  To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Settings</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click OK.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A secure copy program such as <span class="arg">scp</span>, needed to allow files to be copied from host to target.
           Windows versions of this Linux command are available, such as <span class="arg">pscp</span> as provided with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" title="External link"><i>PuTTY</i></a>.
           Alternatively, use DS-5 Debugger Debug Configurations dialog box or Remote System Explorer to transfer files from host to target.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document discusses 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some ARM-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which the example ARM Linux distribution is running.</div>

        <a name="Building%20this%20example"></a><h2>Building this example</h2>
        <div class="para">A pre-built executable is provided for hard-float filesystems.
        The hard-float executable (<span class="arg">hello</span>, compiled with <span class="arg">-mfloat-abi=hard</span>) is targeted at the hardware floating point ABI, as found in, for example, the Linaro 12.04 and later releases.</div>
        
        <div class="para">This example is intended to be built with the GCC cross-compiler for ARM, such as the Linaro GCC toolchain supplied in DS-5.</div>

        <div class="para">This example can be built using the Eclipse (makefile builder) project supplied,
        or directly on the command-line using the <span class="arg">Makefile</span> supplied with the <span class="arg">make</span> utility.</div>
        <div class="para">For a good debug view, the compiler's optimization level is set to -O1 in the <span class="arg">Makefile</span>.  You can change this to raise the optimization
        level to -O2 or -O3 for higher performance code generation, but at the cost of a worse debug view.</div>
        <div class="para">The build produces both stripped and unstripped versions of the ELF executable <span class="arg">hello</span>.
        The unstripped (debug) versions contain debug information for loading into DS-5 Debugger on the host.
        Smaller stripped (no debug) versions for downloading to the target are created by stripping off the debug information.</div>
