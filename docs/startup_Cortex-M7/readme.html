This is a simple example for the purposes of illustrating features of the DS-5 Debugger.  For real-world Cortex-M7 software development, the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) is recommended to be used as a ready-made starting point instead.</div>

DS-5 Debugger enables semihosting automatically if either symbols <span class="arg">__auto_semihosting</span> or <span class="arg">__semihosting_library_function</span> are present in an image.  ARM Compiler 5 and ARM Compiler 6 both add <span class="arg">__semihosting_library_function</span> automatically to an image at link time if that image uses any semihosting-using functions.  If compiling with gcc or an earlier release of armcc, use an alias symbol definition such as <span class="arg">void __auto_semihosting(void) __attribute__ ((alias("main")));</span>

            <li>
            <div class="para">The vector table and default exception handlers are coded in C in <span class="arg">exceptions.c</span>.  The vector table is placed first at the start of the image at address 0x0 as specified in the scatter-file <span class="arg">scatter.scat</span>, by creating a named ELF section with <span class="arg">#pragma arm section</span> then placing that section <span class="arg">+FIRST</span> in the first (root) execution region in the scatter-file.  The first two entries in the vector table are the Initial Stack Pointer and the Initial Program Counter.  The Initial SP comes from the top address of the <span class="arg">ARM_LIB_STACKHEAP</span> region, as a linker-generated symbol <span class="arg">Image$$ARM_LIB_STACKHEAP$$ZI$$Limit</span> for the (default) One Region model.  The Initial PC is the address of the Reset handler, which in this example is the C run-time entry point <span class="arg">__main()</span> that performs scatter-loading and all C run-time library initialization necessary before reaching <span class="arg">main()</span>.  The SysTick handler is in <span class="arg">timer.c</span>.  Default exception handlers to trap all exceptions (other than SysTick and Reset) in an endless loop are provided too.  Note that unlike classic ARM processors, the Cortex-M family of processors do not have branch instructions in their vector tables, but have function pointers instead.  A <span class="arg">typedef</span> for <span class="arg">ExecFuncPtr</span> for the function pointers in the exception table makes this explicit.  These function pointers are all pointers to Thumb code, so have their Least Significant Bits set to indicate Thumb.  Open a <span class="interface">Memory</span> view at address 0x0 to check the addresses and that they all (except for the Initial SP) have their LSBs set.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
            <div class="para">The <span class="arg">main()</span> function in <span class="arg">main.c</span> first tells the processor the location of the vector table, obtained from the scatter-file, by writing its address to the Vector Table Offset Register.  This needs to be done early in case some later actions trigger an exception.  <span class="arg">main()</span> then displays a welcome message with a semihosted <span class="arg">printf()</span>, initializes the MPU, and performs a floating point calculation using either the processor's optional FPU or the software floating point library.  <span class="arg">main()</span> then starts the SysTick timer (see later), initializes the Process Stack Pointer, changes Thread mode to Unprivileged and to use the Process Stack.  Single-step from <span class="arg">main()</span> through this code, using the <span class="interface">Variables</span> view to watch the values in registers changing.  <span class="arg">main()</span> then runs the main application (sorts), then sits in an endless loop, waiting for interrupts.  The MPU initialization function <span class="arg">SCS_init()</span> in <span class="arg">scs.c</span> is a minimal example to show what can be done with the Cortex-M7's optional MPU.  This is for illustration only - it can be removed without affecting the rest of the example.</div>

            <div class="para">The example sorting application in <span class="arg">sorts.c</span> is a simple example of data manipulation using standard C library functionality.  <span class="arg">clock()</span> timing and printing of results is performed via semihosting.  The value of N is limited to 200 to avoid excessive stack usage in <span class="arg">compare_sorts</span> due to the local arrays, because RAM is typically small in Cortex-M systems.</div>

            <div class="para">The SysTick Timer is initialized by <span class="arg">SysTick_init()</span> in <span class="arg">timer.c</span>.  This is a minimal implementation of a count-down timer with an auto-reload value, that triggers a SysTick interrupt when it reaches zero.  The tick period depends on the clock frequency and reload value.  <span class="arg">timer.c</span> also contains the SysTick exception handler <span class="arg">SysTickHandler()</span> that is called from the vector table when a SysTick interrupt occurs.  You can trap SysTick interrupts for debugging by placing a breakpoint on this function.  Use the <span class="interface">Registers</span> view to see the SysTick registers and to watch the timer value changing.  Use the <span class="interface">Variables</span> view to watch the values of <span class="arg">ticks</span> counting up.</div>
