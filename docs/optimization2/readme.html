        <a name="Purpose%20and%20scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This example introduces some additional optimization techniques for application software using ARM Compiler 5, including multi-file optimization, linker feedback and floating point, and is illustrated by a simple bare-metal, semihosted "test" example application.
        It also introduces NEON auto-vectorization, and shows how you can make your source code more friendly to the compiler to generate efficient 
        NEON code.  It also describes some ways to estimate and reduce Stack and Heap usage.  To keep the example clear and simple, the
        Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) module introduced in Optimization1 is omitted, but could easily be added if required.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A BeagleBoard or BeagleBoard-xM and a suitable power supply for it.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">DSTREAM debug hardware and a suitable power supply for it, and a JTAG cable to connect it to BeagleBoard</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in DS-5, TeraTerm for Windows (<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html" title="External link"><i>TeraTerm Website</i></a>) or minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.  This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Boot Loader and provide a serial terminal interface.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.  To open the Terminal view in DS-5, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click OK.  To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Settings</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click OK.

        <div class="para">ARM Compiler 5 provides a number of other optimizations mechanisms.  The following is just a small selection of some of the most interesting features.  For a complete list of all switches, please refer to the documentation.</div>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <div class="para">Multi-file compilation allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations across several files that would not normally be possible with just a single file, including: inlining across files; sharing code segments and literal pool data; improved global data accesses (base pointer re-use); cross-file type-checking.  It can also reduce the number of compiler licence checkouts needed, to help speed up build times.  An example command-line looks like:</div>
<pre class="code">
armcc -c --multifile file1.c file2.c ... fileN.c
</pre>
<div class="para">For more information, please refer to "--multifile" in the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0472-/index.html"><i>ARM Compiler 5 armcc User Guide</i></a>.</div>
<div class="para">Note: it is not currently possible to make use of <span class="arg">--multifile</span> in an Eclipse project build, as this compiles source files individually.  Use the supplied makefile instead.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">Unused functions can be removed by using linker feedback.  The linker can output a list of unused functions:</div>
<pre class="code">
armlink --feedback unused.txt ...
</pre>
<div class="para">which the compiler can use as an input for the next build iteration:</div>
<pre class="code">
armcc --feedback unused.txt ...
</pre>
<div class="para">Each function listed in the feedback file will be recompiled into a separate ELF section on the next build iteration, so that it can be removed by the linker's unused section elimination mechanism.  You must compile and link at least twice.  This is a safe optimization - the function will not be removed if it is found to be used after all.</div>
<div class="para">For more information, please refer to "About linker feedback" in the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0474-/index.html"><i>ARM Compiler 5 armlink User Guide</i></a>.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">The ARM linker is able to inline small functions.  This feature is enabled by linking with <span class="arg">--inline</span>.  Use <span class="arg">--info=inline</span> to list all functions that are inlined by the linker, and the total number of inlines if --inline is used.</div>
<div class="para">For more information, please refer to "About link-time code generation" in the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0474-/index.html"><i>ARM Compiler 5 armlink User Guide</i></a>.</div>

        <div class="para">The Stack and Heap can occupy a significant footprint of RAM in embedded systems.  To manage this RAM usage effectively, it is useful to be able to accurately estimate and minimize the Stack and heap use:</div>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <div class="para">C/C++ code uses the stack intensively. For example, the stack is used to hold:</div>
        <ul>
        <li><div class="para">the return address of functions</div></li>

Try to avoid your application "leaking" memory, by ensuring that each malloc/new has a matching free/delete.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">You can estimate your application's stack and heap size requirements using the following methods:</div>
        <ul>
        <li><div class="para">For a static estimation, link with <span class="arg">--callgraph</span> to produce a static callgraph.  This shows the size of each function, plus the stack space it consumes, and the worst case overall stack usage from the entry point.  This is a static analysis, and ignores any additional dynamic stack requirements, such as for (possibly nested) interrupt handlers.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">For an alternative static estimation, link with <span class="arg">--info=stack</span> or <span class="arg">--info=summarystack</span> to list the stack usage of all global symbols.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">For a dynamic estimation, you must run your application on a target.  In your code, first allocate space for the stack/heap that is much larger than you expect to require.  Using a debugger, fill the stack/heap memory with a known value, for example, <span class="arg">0xDEADDEAD</span>, then run your application, or a fixed portion of it.  Aim to use as much of the stack/heap as possible in the test run.  For example, for stack estimation, try to exercise the most deeply nested function calls and the worst case path found by the static analysis.  Try to generate interrupts where appropriate, so that they are included in the stack usage too.  For heap estimation, exercise the paths with the largest <span class="arg">malloc()</span> or <span class="arg">new</span> calls.  After your application has finished executing, examine the stack/heap memory to see how many of the known values (0xDEADDEAD) have been overwritten.  Always use a worst-case run.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">For an alternative dynamic estimation, start with a stack/heap region that is slightly undersized, then set a watchpoint at the end of the stack/heap region, run your code as above, and if the watchpoint gets hit, the region size needs increasing.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">Another alternative dynamic estimation technique is to use the target's MMU or MPU.  Configure a No Access region just below the stack (or just above the heap).  An overflow at run-time will trigger a data abort.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">For ARM Linux applications, use DS-5's Streamline Performance Analyser to reveal stack usage.  The stack usage for each thread and function is shown in the Call Paths and Functions tabs respectively.</div></li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
        <div class="para">You can help to reduce your application's stack requirements by:</div>
        <ul>
        <li><div class="para">writing small functions that only require a small number of variables</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">minimizing the number of variables that are in use at any given time at each point in a function</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">avoiding the use of large local structures, arrays or C++ objects - consider allocating them on the heap instead with <span class="arg">malloc()</span>.</div></li>
