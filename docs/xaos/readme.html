        <a name="Purpose%20and%20scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This document describes how to build, run and analyze the Xaos example provided with DS-5.
        Xaos is an interactive fractal zoomer application, as described on the <a href="http://matek.hu/xaos/doku.php" title="External link"><i>Xaos web site</i></a>.
        This example uses Xaos version 3.5 - the source code is downloadable from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xaos/files/XaoS/3.5/xaos-3.5.tar.gz/download" title="External link"><i>SourceForge</i></a>.
        Some small additions and changes have been made to the original sources by ARM Ltd to illustrate Streamline annotation support.  Changes are marked with "ARM Ltd" to allow them to be easily found.</div>

        <div class="para">This example's files can be found in the <span class="arg">...\xaos</span> directory within <span class="arg">Linux_examples.zip</span>.  Import this .zip archive into Eclipse to access the <span class="arg">xaos</span> project.</div>

        <div class="para">This example is intended to be run and analyzed on an ARM Linux hardware target that supports Streamline, though it can also be run only (not analyzed with Streamline) on a software model such as the FVP model of Versatile Express with Cortex-A9x1 Core Tile (VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model).</div>
        <div class="para">Example Streamline capture data for Xaos is provided in the <span class="arg">...\xaos\Streamline</span> directory.</div>
        <div class="para">To view the Streamline capture, first launch the Streamline application.
        In the <span class="interface">Streamline Data</span> view, click on the <span class="interface">Edit Locations...</span> button to display the
        <span class="interface">ARM Streamline Data</span> dialog. Click <span class="interface">Add</span> to display the <span class="interface">Browse to Folder</span> dialog box.
        Navigate to the <span class="arg">...\xaos\Streamline</span> directory, then click <span class="interface">OK</span>.  
        The location is added to the list of Analysis Data Locations. Click <span class="interface">OK</span> to close the dialog.</div>

        <div class="para">The example Streamline Capture Data provided in <span class="arg">xaos-multithreaded-VE-A15x2-A7x3.apc</span> was captured from Xaos being run
        multi-threaded (with 5 threads) on a Versatile Express Cortex-A15x2+A7x3 ("TC2") big.LITTLE platform.
        Double-click on <span class="arg">xaos-multithreaded-VE-A15x2-A7x3</span> in <span class="interface">Streamline Data</span> to generate an Analysis Report.
        Click on the (xaos) process to show its 5 threads and view the annotations ("main init", "compute fractal", "update display").
        Select X-Ray mode to view the CPU core affinity, to see which threads are running on which core/cluster at any moment.</div>

        <div class="para">By default, no libraries (.so) are specified in the <span class="interface">Program Images</span> of the Analysis Report generation dialog, so the Analysis Report gives information
        about all libraries being accessed, but not their contents.  By specifying a library in the Analysis Report generation dialog, the
        function calls into that library are then revealed in the Analysis Report.  The library does not need to be a full debug info library - just
        having function names in its symbol table is sufficient.  For full visibility of a library's internals, a debug version of the library (not
        provided in DS-5) would need to be specified.
        For example, <span class="arg">libpthread.so</span> is frequently used/called in the multi-threaded Xaos, and has a relatively small number of distinct
        functions (as compared to, say, libc).  To view the calls/usage of libpthread.so, specify the library such as <span class="arg">libpthread-2.17.so</span>
        in the Analysis Report generation dialog.  This library must be a copy on your host computer of the file in your ARM Linux target's file system, such as those in <span class="arg">...\DS-5 Workspace\distribution\filesystem\linaro_hf\lib</span>.</div>

        <div class="para">Linux kernel symbols can also be tracked in the same way by specifying the appropriate <span class="arg">vmlinux</span> for your kernel in <span class="interface">Program Images</span>.</div>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document refers to 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some ARM-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which the example ARM Linux distribution is running.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A host workstation (Linux or Windows) is required to build the example, communicate with the target, and run DS-5 Debugger.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">An ARM Linux hardware target such as Versatile Express Cortex-A9x4, ... that is configured for Streamline (with gator driver and daemon).</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A local display device (for example, an LCD panel) connected directly to your board,
           or a remote display such as an Exceed or Xming X server running on the host workstation.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in DS-5, TeraTerm for Windows (<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html" title="External link"><i>TeraTerm Website</i></a>) or minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.  This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the ARM Linux boot process and provide a terminal interface to ARM Linux.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.  To open the Terminal view in DS-5, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click OK.  To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Settings</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click OK.</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">A secure copy program such as <span class="arg">scp</span> to allow files to be copied from host to target.
           Windows versions of this Linux command are available, such as <span class="arg">pscp</span> as provided with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" title="External link"><i>PuTTY</i></a>.
           Alternatively, use DS-5 Debugger Debug Configurations dialog or Remote System Explorer to transfer files from host to target.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="para">Xaos is a graphical application in a windowing environment, so a mouse should preferably be connected to the target in addition to a normal keyboard.
        If using the VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model on the host, the mouse and keyboard of the host can be used to control the Xaos application.</div>

        <a name="Building%20this%20example"></a><h2>Building this example</h2>
        <div class="para">A pre-built executable is provided for hard-float filesystems.
        The hard-float executable (<span class="arg">xaos</span>, compiled with <span class="arg">-mfloat-abi=hard</span>) is targeted at the hardware floating point ABI, as found in, for example, the Linaro 12.04 and later releases.</div>
        
        <div class="para">This example is intended to be built with the GCC cross-compiler for ARM, such as the Linaro GCC toolchain supplied in DS-5.</div>

        <div class="para">This example can be built using the Eclipse (makefile builder) project supplied,
        or directly on the command-line using the <span class="arg">Makefile</span> supplied with the <span class="arg">make</span> utility.</div>
        <div class="para">To rebuild this example, you must have imported into Eclipse the "DS-5 Linux Example Distribution" package that can be downloaded from the Downloads page of <a href="http://ds.arm.com" title="External link"><i>ARM Development Studio 5 (DS-5) Web Site</i></a>.  This provides the example Linux <span class="arg">distribution</span> project/directory, and headers and libraries that are compatible with the example Linux distribution.  The <span class="arg">distribution</span> project does not need to be built (actually, it cannot be built).</div>
        <div class="para">For good performance, the compiler's optimization level is set to -O2 in the <span class="arg">Makefile</span>.  You can change this to lower the
        optimization level to -O0 or -O1 for a better debug view, but at the cost of worse performing code generation.
        Alternatively, you can raise it to -O3 and compile with NEON vectorization by uncommenting <span class="arg">VECT_CFLAGS</span> in <span class="arg">BASE_CFLAGS</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">The application is built with thread support enabled by default.  <span class="arg">aconfig.h</span> contains <span class="arg">#define USE_PTHREAD</span> and
        the <span class="arg">Makefile</span> has <span class="arg">-pthread</span> in its compile and link steps.  The number of threads for Xaos to create and use is set when Xaos is launched with, for example, <span class="arg">./xaos -threads 5</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">The build produces both stripped and unstripped versions of the ELF executables <span class="arg">xaos</span> and <span class="arg">xaos</span>.
        The unstripped (debug) versions contain debug information for loading into DS-5 Debugger on the host.
        Smaller stripped (no debug) versions for downloading to the target are created by stripping off the debug information.</div>
        <div class="para">Note that the other build files provided as part of xaos-3.5, such as <span class="arg">configure</span>, <span class="arg">Makefile.ini</span> and <span class="arg">install-sh</span> are not used here.</div>
