        <a name="Purpose%20and%20scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This example illustrates the use of Application Rewind in DS-5 Debugger to debug an ARM Linux application.
        This is a console-based 'toy' example, that fills an array with some values.  The code supplied contains an array overflow bug that shows up later as a null pointer.  Because the effect of the bug does not show up until (much) later, it is difficult to locate using traditional debug techniques.  Application Rewind makes it easy to find the problem.</div>
        <div class="note"><div class="para">
<div class="bold">Note</div>
<div>Note: Application Rewind is not supported on ARM Models (such as FVP model).</div>
</div></div>
        <div class="note"><div class="para">
<div class="bold">Note</div>
<div>Note: This example uses watchpoints, but not all Linux targets support watchpoints.  This depends on the ARM Architecture of the target processor, which CP14 registers have been implemented in the target processor, the version of the Linux kernel, and whether the Linux kernel was built with <span class="arg">CONFIG_HAVE_HW_BREAKPOINT</span>.  Watchpoints are supported for ARMv7 if all CP14 registers are implemented with Linux kernel version 2.6.37 or later, and for ARMv7.1 with kernel version 3.2 or later.</div>
</div></div>

        <div class="para">This example's files can be found in the <span class="arg">...\application_rewind_2</span> directory within <span class="arg">Linux_examples.zip</span>.  Import this .zip archive into Eclipse to access the <span class="arg">application_rewind_2</span> project.</div>
        
        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <div class="para">A host workstation (Linux or Windows) is required to build the example, communicate with the target, and run DS-5 Debugger.</div>
        <div class="para">The following software may also be needed on the host to run and debug the example:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in DS-5, TeraTerm for Windows (<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html" title="External link"><i>TeraTerm Website</i></a>) or minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.  This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the ARM Linux boot process and provide a terminal interface to ARM Linux.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.  To open the Terminal view in DS-5, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click OK.  To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Settings</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click OK.</div></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document discusses 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work.
        The 'target' system is some ARM-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which the example ARM Linux distribution is running.</div>

        <div class="para">A pre-built executable is provided for hard-float filesystems.
        The hard-float executable (<span class="arg">app_bug</span>, compiled with <span class="arg">-mfloat-abi=hard</span>) is targeted at the hardware floating point ABI, as found in, for example, the Linaro 12.04 and later releases.</div>
        
        <div class="para">This example is intended to be built with the GCC cross-compiler for ARM, such as the Linaro GCC toolchain supplied in DS-5.</div>

        <div class="para">This example can be built using the Eclipse (makefile builder) project supplied,
        or directly on the command-line using the <span class="arg">Makefile</span> supplied with the <span class="arg">make</span> utility.</div>
        <div class="para">For the best debug view, the compiler's optimization level is set to -O0 in the <span class="arg">Makefile</span>.  You can change this to raise the optimization
        level to -O1, -O2 or -O3 for higher performance code generation, but at the cost of a worse debug view.</div>
        <div class="para">The build produces both stripped and unstripped versions of the ELF executable <span class="arg">app_bug</span>.
        The unstripped (debug) versions contain debug information for loading into DS-5 Debugger on the host.
        Smaller stripped (no debug) versions for downloading to the target are created by stripping off the debug information.</div>
